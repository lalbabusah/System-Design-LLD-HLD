# System-Design

## High-Level Design (HLD)
High-Level Design (HLD) provides an architectural overview of a system. It focuses on major components, their interactions, data flow, and technology choices. HLD helps stakeholders understand the system structure and integration points before detailed design and implementation.

## Low-Level Design (LLD)
Low-Level Design (LLD) describes the internal logic of individual modules, classes, and functions. It includes class diagrams, method details, database schemas, and design patterns. LLD ensures that each component is well-defined, maintainable, and follows best practices like SOLID principles.

### Key Differences
- **HLD:** Big-picture architecture, modules, data flow, technology stack, integration.
- **LLD:** Detailed logic, class/method design, database tables, design patterns, code structure.

Both HLD and LLD are essential for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.
