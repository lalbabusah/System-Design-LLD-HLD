## High-Level Design (HLD)

High-Level Design (HLD) is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow for a system. HLD provides an overview of the solution, focusing on how the system will be organized and how different parts will interact.

### Key Components of HLD
- **Architecture Diagram:** Visual representation of system components and their interactions.
- **Module Description:** Brief explanation of each major module or service.
- **Data Flow:** How data moves between components.
- **Technology Stack:** List of technologies, frameworks, and tools used.
- **Integration Points:** External systems or APIs the solution interacts with.

### Example: E-commerce System HLD

**Architecture Diagram:**
- User Interface (Web/Mobile)
- Application Server
- Database
- Payment Gateway
- Notification Service

**Module Description:**
- **User Module:** Handles registration, login, profile management.
- **Product Module:** Manages product catalog, search, and details.
- **Order Module:** Processes orders, payments, and order history.
- **Inventory Module:** Tracks stock levels and updates.
- **Notification Module:** Sends emails/SMS for order updates.

**Data Flow Example:**
1. User places an order via UI.
2. Application server validates and processes the order.
3. Payment gateway processes payment.
4. Order details saved in database.
5. Notification service sends confirmation to user.

**Technology Stack Example:**
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Payment: Stripe API
- Notifications: Twilio API

HLD helps stakeholders understand the overall structure and interactions in the system before moving to detailed design and implementation.
